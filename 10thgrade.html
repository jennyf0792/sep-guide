  <p> When I entered software engineering, it was the first year of the program. Thus, we were like the testers so the city could learn the do’s and don’ts. In my year, my experience was pretty unusual, the classes were separated by gender. It was pretty
    empowering since, in the tech field women are often not taken as seriously, but in this class it was always a girl that solved a problem or answered the question. </p>
